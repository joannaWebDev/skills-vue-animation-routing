    <p>
      I am a Creative Visionary. I come with an unconventional resume and tons
      of unique experience, making me the perfect person to change up stale
      conversations, craft unique solutions to problems, and think big picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm driven, think outside the box, and have big dreams of a new start -
      meaning I'm ready to work as hard as it takes to find a career thatâ€™s
      meaningful and lucrative.
